# Fraud-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

This repository explores the use of machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, leveraging the Fraud detection dataset provided in the CMS. The dataset ('fraud.csv') contains ten columns representing transaction details.

a) Naive Bayes Model:

Implementation of a Naive Bayes model for fraud detection.

b) K Nearest Neighbors (k=5) Model:
Implementation of a K Nearest Neighbors model with k=5 for fraud detection.

c) Cross Validation
Application of 10-fold cross-validation on both Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbors models.

d) Evaluation Metrics
Metrics Computed:
Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Recall, Precision for both models.

Comparison and Decision:

Comprehensive analysis and comparison of metrics to determine the superior model based on evaluation criteria.
Explore the code and findings in the Jupyter Notebook to gain insights into the effectiveness of Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbors models in fraud detection.
